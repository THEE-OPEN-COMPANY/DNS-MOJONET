What is the DNS system?
While we're all used to typing text addresses into our browser and email programs, such as MAUA-AFRICA.com, the Internet doesn't run on text. The Internet actually works on numerical addresses called IP addresses, just in the same way we dial telephone numbers. The problem is that numbers are not easy to remember. Therefore, an Internet wide address book, called the Domain Name System (DNS), was created to make navigation much easier.

Every time you type an address into your browser, your computer or mobile device is actually querying a DNS server. It has to ask for the IP address of the destination server before it can retrieve any data for you. For example, typing "google.com" into your browser will trigger your computer to check its DNS server for Google's IP address. The DNS server will return a number like 173.194.70.113.

The very last part of a domain, e.g. .com, is called a top-level domain (TLD). TLDs are controlled by central authorities. For example, the .com TLD is controlled by ICANN in the United States. These central authorities allow third party companies, known as registrars, to deal with accepting domain name orders and customer service.

Whenever anyone has a complaint with a website, the central authority for its TLD has the ultimate say on what happens to it. In most real world cases, lawyers, copyright holders, etc., will simply contact the domain's registrar. However, the potential for commands from a central authority should be of concern to groups who will suffer due to censorship.But mojonet has a custom DNS System that mask's the long bit domain(dftyrdfyt87743cgtr5r5.bit),so it issues a name to that bit domain that is easily searched by the user , so behind the searchable name there is the actual .bit domain name
